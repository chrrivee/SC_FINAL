			<h1>Why I want to be in Student Council ?</h1>
			<p>
				Student Council is a group of students who are elected to represent the student body in the school. They are responsible for organizing events, fundraisers, and other activities that benefit the school and the community. Student Council members are also responsible for voicing the concerns and ideas of the student body to the school administration. Being a part of Student Council is a great way to get involved in your school and make a positive impact on your community.
